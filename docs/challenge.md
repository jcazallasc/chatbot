# Landbot: Backend Challenge

- Create a bot in app.landbot.io, which asks the user for name, email and phone.

- In the bot use a Webhook node to call the API you will have to implement in Python (as a URL you can enable a tunnel to localhost with Ngrok)

- Your API should receive the client data, store it on a DB and after 1 minute send a welcome email to the user.
